Image Classification with CNNs on CIFAR-10 üñºÔ∏èüîç

This repository implements an image classification pipeline using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the widely-used CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes (e.g., airplanes, automobiles, cats, dogs), making it a benchmark for evaluating computer vision models. The project explores the design, training, and evaluation of CNNs to achieve robust performance.
